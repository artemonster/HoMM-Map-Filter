1. Game version
2. Map size
3. Player count
4. Has dungeon?
5. Is allied?
6. Minimal difficulty

Usage
===============
Take the executable, along with zlib.dll and place in maps directry of your game. Also, make a non_matched empty directory. 
Run the app and input the criteria.
If app crashes, run with verbose mode on (sometimes the maps are corrupted and they crash the app).
